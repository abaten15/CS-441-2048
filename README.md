# 2048

I have remade classic 2048 game bby updating the graphics and color schemes. The cartoony UI of this app feels smooth to play and gives a nicer feeling to game. All of the graphics were custom made using GIMP. 

This app is the classic 2048 game. Your swipes slide tile in the direction you want and merges tiles that have the same value. The goal is to merge enough tiles that one has a value of 2048. However, if you run out of space to swipe, you lose. 

The graphics of this game were intended to give a cartoony feel to the gameplay. I felt this made the gameplay smoother and brightened the players mood while playing.
